# Financial Data Access

Recent-price and read-only historical data access through the Relay Data API
(`https://api.rebyte.ai/api/data`).

This directory defines data access for stock analysis and backtesting. Direct
price APIs provide the current and previous exchange-local calendar dates;
the Financial Data Service provides historical prices and every non-price
dataset. Read `SKILL.md` for the routing rules and exact request shapes.

The API is market-agnostic: it exposes a single catalog of tables and a read-only
SQL endpoint. Whatever tables the service holds appear in the catalog — the skill
does not special-case any market.

Inside a Rebyte VM/workspace the skill and CLI read the sandbox token and relay URL
from `/home/user/.rebyte.ai/auth.json`.

## Historical-lake workflow: catalog → schema → query

```bash
# 1. List every table + its description (financial/catalog; optional --market us|cn)
python3 scripts/anyfinancial_cli.py catalog

# 2. Read a table's exact columns before querying it
python3 scripts/anyfinancial_cli.py schema cn.bars_1m

# 3. Run one read-only SQL statement
python3 scripts/anyfinancial_cli.py query "SELECT trade_time, c FROM cn.bars_1m WHERE ts_code = '000001.SZ' ORDER BY trade_time DESC LIMIT 10"
```

The CLI has no required third-party packages — it uses `requests` when available and
falls back to Python's standard-library HTTP client.

## Data builders

Optional pipelines that build a local, incrementally-refreshed store on top of a
served table — for workloads the read-only SQL endpoint does not cover directly
(offline analysis, vector search). They reuse the same auth and
`catalog → schema → query` API as the CLI above.

- [`data_builder/us_news/`](data_builder/us_news/README.md) — mirrors the served
  `us.news` table to a local SQLite, refreshes to today, embeds only new ids, and
  adds SQL + semantic ("more-like-this") search over the service's 1536-dim
  `content_embedding`.

## SQL rules

- Write SQL using the supported patterns in `SKILL.md` (e.g. `now()`, `date_trunc`, `date_bin`, `INTERVAL` math) — not vendor-specific idioms like `DATEADD`/`GETDATE()`/`TOP`. See `SKILL.md` for the pattern table and the on-error/do-not-loop rule.
- Read-only, one statement per request.
- Start with `SELECT` or `WITH`. (`SHOW`/`DESCRIBE`/`EXPLAIN` are not supported by the service — see `SKILL.md` for the discovery path.)
- No mutating statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `CREATE`, `TRUNCATE`, …).
